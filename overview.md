## Discard: The Game of Weeding

Discard is a card game for 2-(6? 4?) players. You are all librarians, but unlike most games that have a library theme, this game is not about acquiring books but getting rid of them, and possibly also complicating your opponent's ability to get rid of them. Winner is... who gets rid of the most books? 


GAME IDEAS:
 * be able to be played by at least two players (solo game also maybe?)
 * be easy to learn - you know, like German style stuff
 * involve the ability to either help or hinder your opponents
    * cards represent books. *should* some cards also have special abilities? Should they have "suits", e.g., science books, fiction books, history books etc? What abilities should individual books have?
